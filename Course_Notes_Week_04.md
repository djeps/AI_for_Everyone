AI is definitely going to affect the way we live
It is already having an impact on society
Huge advancements in industry, creating a lot of new opportunities
But it's also impacting certain job positions (loss of jobs due to automation and AI)
Sometimes unrightfully attributed to AI
There's also a lot of hype about AI
While there are certainly limitations to AI and what it can do
Bias
Adversarial attacks
This is a less discussed topic
There should be a 'Goldilocks rule' around AI i.e. too much of one or the other is not favorable i.e. we shouldn't be
Too optimistic about it (superintelligent, sentient robots are soon taking over planet Earth)
Too pessimistic either (AI cannot do everything so there's no point in further research and investing resources in AI projects)
Just right - while AI certainly can't do everything, it will inevitable change and transform industries (across the board!) and society
Limitations of AI
Performance limitations
Sometimes lack of explainability or extremely difficult one (i.e. difficult to explain what AI is doing and how it is doing it)
Biased AI agents due to biased data e.g.
Learning unhealthy stereotypes
Facial recognition in people with lighter or darker skin
Discrimination against certain ethnic groups (for example a banking AI agent deciding on a bank loan)
Maintaining transparency and having frequent audits might combat bias
Although there are certainly some technical ways to go about it as well
Adversarial attacks on AI
An AI agent is 'seeing' and 'experiencing' images in an entirely different way than humans do
Therefore, a minor perturbation in the pixels of an input image analyzed by an AI agent, might result in a different classification
Defences do exist, albeit very technical (with an inherent performance penalty on the AI agent) and costly
Adverse use of AI
... or using AI in a bad context, such as
Creating deep fakes... images or videos of people doing something they have never done, therefore targeting certain individuals and harming their personal lives
Oppressive surveillance, affecting democracy and privacy
Fake comments
Effects of AI on developing economies
Sometimes bad (loss of jobs due to extensive automation)
AI is automation on steroids!
But we should be fair and discuss job displacement as well i.e. while certainly there are job losses due to AI, at the same time there are new jobs created as a result of adopting AI
Hence investing in education and updating the entire model, increases the odds of future generations being fairly positioned on the new labor market!
In some case good (for example in certain developing economies it helped 'leapfrog' certain technologies and allowed early adoption of new ones)
Use AI to strengthen and enhance a country's already existing potential or a vertical industry rather than competing with others over the same
