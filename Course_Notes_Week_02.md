ML algorithms are able to learn or map A to B or input(s) to output
Key steps of any AI/ML project would be:
Collect (enough) data
What's enough? Whatever is reasonable data to start training the model
We need good and bad samples i.e. data that correctly represents the input we wish to train the model on, as well as data from the other spectrum
For example, in the case of an image recognition system that is to train to recognize cats, we need lots of images with cats and vise versa, lots of images which don't represent cats
Train the model
This is an iterative process i.e. we train the model until its performance becomes good enough and acceptable
What is our acceptance criteria? What is the acceptance threshold?
When training the model, we usually work with a training set (2/3) and a test set (1/3)
Never expect 100% accuracy! It's just simply impossible! Assuming that it's possible is assuming ML is perfect and the dataset impeccable - which certainly, is not the case!
Deploy the model (e.g. as part of a product/service)
This too is not a one-time effort as we may realize the model isn't good enough and we might need to improve it
For example, in a case of a speech recognition project, we may train the model mostly based on data samples from only one single dialect region of the spoken English
In this case, we need to get data back and fine-tune the model
The steps of a typical Data Science project are somewhat different and the reason is very straight forward
A typical ML projects deals with a very large data set and tries to figure out the model that correctly maps A to B
A typical DS projects usually deals with a smaller dataset where the expected outcome is an actual and actionable insight i.e. a conclusion derived from which me may decide to take further actions
The key steps in a DS project would be:
Collect data
Analyze the data
Similarly to a ML project, this is an iterative process i.e. repeat until our insights are firmly set an clear
Suggest a hypothesis
Act upon the insights i.e. take certain actions - optimize and automate!
Periodically analyze new data and adapt/adjust if necessary
Data and the use of data is transformative for every job out there
How to select a potential AI project to work on...
A cross-functional team of domain experts and AI experts is needed
While the former will have a pretty good idea of what generates business value (business diligence), the later will have a good idea of what's possible to do and what's not (technical diligence)
The cross-functional team will then try to find the crosssection between the two i.e. what's possible to do while at the same time generating business value
Technical diligence
Is it doable
What (and if any) data is available and how much data is needed
Timeline!
Business diligence
Will it...
lower existings costs
increase revenue
help launch a new product/service
or all of the above
Ethical diligence
When speaking about AI in general, we should be talking about automating tasks and not automating positions!
Having more data is almost never bad, but sometimes we are able to 'start small' and 'grow big'
Build or buy!?
Strictly speaking, ML projects could be done either way i.e. in-house or outsourced
DS projects are typically (and best when) done in-house - or at least, they should be done that way.
Then there are golden standards in every industry i.e. systems which are readily available and proven.
Don't sprint in front of a fast moving train! IT makes no sense. Buy someone else's platform.
